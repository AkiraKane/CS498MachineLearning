Neeraj Asthana (nasthan2) Homework 5 Code:

All code is contained in a file called "HW5.R"

This file can be run using R.

The Report is contained in a file labeled "Report.pdf"

The plots are included in the report however I have also include the plots in the zip file. I have also included the jpgs for the final test image just in case those pasted in the pdf were not clear enough.
