Neeraj Asthana (nasthan2) Homework 6 Code:

All code is contained in a script file called "HW6.R"

This file can be run using R. 

All code for Problem 1 (linear regression) is included first under the heading "##Problem 1". I used the dataset with 70 predictors. The code for Problem 2 (logistic regression) is included afterwards under the heading "##Problem2". I generated a csv from the data from the xls file to operate on it. 

The Report is contained in a file labeled "Homework 6 Report.pdf". All plots are included in the report as well as in the folder labelled "Plots".
